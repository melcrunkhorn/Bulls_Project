               of the most popular sports league in the world and is well known
               for moving a millionary betting market that uses the countless
               statistical data generated after each game to feed the wagers.
               This leads to the existence of a rich historical database that
               motivates us to discover implicit knowledge in it. In this
               paper, we use complex network statistics to analyze the NBA
               database in order to create models to represent the behavior of
               teams in the NBA. Results of complex network-based models are
               compared with box score statistics, such as points, rebounds and
               assists per game. We show the box score statistics play a
               significant role for only a small fraction of the players in the
               league. We then propose new models for predicting a team success
               based on complex network metrics, such as clustering coefficient
               and node degree. Complex network-based models present good
               results when compared to box score statistics, which underscore
               the importance of capturing network relationships in a community
               such as the NBA.",
